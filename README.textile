h2. Finite State Machine: An AS3 utility

This utility is a re-architecturing of the "pureMVC original":http://trac.puremvc.org/Utility_AS3_StateMachine

h3. Aims

To keep the utility:
* as simple as the original, but to give greater flexibility for customisation.
* free from any framework dependencies.
* free from any comms bus dependencies (events, signals, notifications).
* free from any data dependencies.
