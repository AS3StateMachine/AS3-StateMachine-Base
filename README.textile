h2. Finite State Machine: An AS3 utility

Version 1.0.001
This utility is a re-architecturing of the "pureMVC original":http://trac.puremvc.org/Utility_AS3_StateMachine

h3. Aims

To keep the utility:
* as simple as the original, but to give greater flexibility for customisation.
* free from any framework dependencies.
* free from any comms bus dependencies (events, signals, notifications).
* free from any data dependencies (for declaring the FSM).

These are the base classes only, concrete implementations are listed below

# "Standard Event StateMachine:":http://github.com/neilmanuell/AS3-Standard-Event-StateMachine this extension can be used in any event driven framework (eg Robotlegs).
# "Enhanced Event StateMachine:":http://github.com/neilmanuell/AS3-Enhanced-Event-StateMachine this extension can be used in any event driven framework (eg Robotlegs).
# "Signal StateMachine for Robotlegs:":http://github.com/neilmanuell/AS3-Signal-StateMachine-for-Robotlegs this extension is specifically for use with Robotlegs using Signals.

Coming soon (well, eventually)

# "Standard StateMachine for pureMVC:" replicates the original utilities functionality.
# "Enhanced StateMachine for pureMVC:"
