h2. Change log

h3. AS3-StateMachine-Base-V1-3-004: 20/03/2011
* ITransitionPhase: added equals method of comparison with other
  objects.
* Added StateDecodeError


h3. AS3-StateMachine-Base-V1-3-000: 17/03/2011
* ILoggable: now allows each phase logging to be individually activated
  by using bit-masking and the new ITransitionPhase
* ITransitionPhase: interface for describing a transition phase
* IState: added referringAction getter

h3. AS3-StateMachine-Base-V1-2-000: 31/12/2010
* ILoggable: added interface for capturing log messages.
* TraceStateLogger: implementation of ILoggable that wraps a trace statement.
* StateMachine: now implements ILoggable and logs appropriate stages.
* BaseTransitionController: now implements ILoggable and logs appropriate stages.
* BaseTransitionController: Removed Cancelled phase from the main transition
  into its own dispatchedCancelled protected method. This solves circular
  cancellations with actioning from a cancelled phase.

 h3. AS3-StateMachine-Base-V1-1-001: 2/13/2010
* IState: added getter length to retrieve the number of transitions
  defined.

 h3. AS3-StateMachine-Base-V1-1-000: 27/11/2010
